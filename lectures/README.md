# Viewing the lectures without installing Python and Jupyter

Github mangles the math when it renders Jupyter notebooks.
To see the math rendered correctly, go to
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
There you'll see a search field. Paste
the URL of the github notebook into the search field.
nbviewer will render the notebook, math and all.

For your convenience, I'll provide links to the nbviewer-version of each 
lecture in the [course schedule](../README.md#schedule). 

# Downloading files

To download files from this site,
open the file in GitHub,
click on the `Raw` button,
and right-click `Save Page As...`.
Make sure the file is saved with the correct filename extension.
For example, the extension in the filename `libmath9.py` is `.py`.  (You may need to set the `Format` dropdown in your download dialog box to `Page Source` and edit the file name in the dialog box to have the correct filename extension.)

# Using these Jupyter notebooks as live presentations (for those interested)

These notebooks were created using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE),
 a Jupyter extension that 
allows the notebook to be used as a live presentation via Reveal.js. 
Succinct documentation can be found 
[here](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/).
