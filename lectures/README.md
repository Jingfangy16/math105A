# Using these Jupyter notebooks as live presentations 

These notebooks were created using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE),
 a Jupyter extension that 
allows the notebook to be used as a live presentation via Reveal.js. 
Succinct documentation can be found 
[here](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/).

Github mangles the math when it renders Jupyter notebook. 
To see the math rendered correctly, go to 
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). 
There you'll see a search field. Paste 
the URL of the github notebook into the search field.
nbviewer will render the notebook, math and all.
