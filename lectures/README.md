# Using these Jupyter notebooks as live presentations 

These notebooks were created using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE),
 a Jupyter extension that 
allows the notebook to be used as a live presentation via Reveal.js. 
Succinct documentation can be found 
[here](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/).
