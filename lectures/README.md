# Viewing the lectures without installing Python and Jupyter

Github mangles the math when it renders Jupyter notebooks.
To see the math rendered correctly, go to
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
There you'll see a search field. Paste
the URL of the github notebook into the search field.
nbviewer will render the notebook, math and all.

For your convenience, I'll provide links to the nbviewer-version of each 
lecture in the [course schedule](../README.md#schedule). 

# Interacting with the lecture notebooks

In lab, we will learn how to view, edit and run Jupyter notebooks. 
To download Jupyter notebooks from this site, 
open the notebook in GitHub, 
click on the `Raw` button, 
and right-click `Save Page As...`.

# Using these Jupyter notebooks as live presentations (for those interested)

These notebooks were created using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE),
 a Jupyter extension that 
allows the notebook to be used as a live presentation via Reveal.js. 
Succinct documentation can be found 
[here](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/).
